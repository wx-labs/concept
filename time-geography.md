# Time Geography

To better understand the experiential commons, we need a set of techniques to effectively represent and analyze purposeful human activity as it unfolds within the constraints and opportunities afforded by space, time, and a wide variety of individual and societal factors.

> Describing daily human activities and accounting for activity-related behavior has been a major objective of behavioral geography, experimental psychology, transportation research, and related fields for several decades. Starting with the work of Hagerstrand and the Lund School in the 1950s and 1960s, time geography was the first successful approach to provide a systematic framework for tracking and analyzing individual activity in space and time. This framework brings together a number of ideas that have laid the foundations of vibrant lines of research which continue to this day.

The complementary notion of 'project', consisting of the entire series of activities necessary for the completion of a purposeful undertaking, brings into the picture the perspective of goal orientation in either individual or social behavior.
