Most large-scale databases of "place" continue to be designed for and in the service of purely administrative uses whether it tax collection or business listings. That's not going to change but what is changing is that **people are discovering that there is a need and a desire for richer and more expressive set of tools with which to talk about location.** -- [Aaron Straup Cope](http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2010/11/14/andthen/)

A brief public service announcement: If you've never read Kevin Lynch's "The
Image of the City" go and do that now. We don't have time to talk about his
ideas, here, but he was right then and he's still right now and it's **an
especially useful guide to help think about personal cartographies and
networked places.** -- [Aaron Straup Cope](http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2010/11/14/andthen/)

Homemade maps can be better than professional ones at eliminating extraneous detail, playing with scale, simplifying complex forms, and mapping remote terrain or interiors.

Even if all computerized route maps eventually learn to mimic the most useful aspects of our homemade creations, we'll keep drawing maps for one another and for ourselves. We'll do it because we'll come up with new things to chart and convey, and because we like to share our spatial understanding of the world.

**The reduction of the spatially complex to simplicity though the application of topology is a wonderful concept.** I have a small device, limited by width and height which can show information in a simple linear manner. It uses the same data as a much larger device but is less concerned with detail beyond the central corridor of information. It relaxes the need for spatial accuracy and his highly portable. Scale and direction are also greatly relaxed and it delivers just what I need to know. -- [Alan MacEachren](http://creative-jar.com/insights/mobile/the-joy-of-stripping-understanding-mobile/)
