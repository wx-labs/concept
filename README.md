Wx is focused on [psychogeographic engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography).  We're all about the [pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics) of place.  We aim to develop a toolkit to help guide people through unfamiliar territory.

Our initial toolset is targeted at Airbnb [superhosts](https://www.airbnb.com/superhost) and their guests.

**Trax** is a tool for encoding a host's personal psychogeography: their own
idiosyncratic view of home and neighborhood.  It's the napkin on which a host
can sketch out a personalized map of their domain for guests.

**Trex** is a companion tool for guests.  It provides access to a host's
**trax**.

So, we way that a host *lays* **trax** and a guest *undertakes* **trex** along
these trax.
