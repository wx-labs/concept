First, consider the [megatrends](http://skift.com/2015/01/13/new-skift-magazine-megatrends-defining-travel-in-2015/) shaping the future of travel:

* mobile
* seamless
* experiential

As I read it, [a new mode of travel](https://github.com/wx-labs/concept/blob/master/resources.md#the-future-of-travel) is emerging, with different objectives and expectations.

This presents new design opportunities.  With this in mind, we're embarking on a new venture:

![wx labs](images/wx-labs.png)

Wx is focused on [psychogeographic engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography).  We're all about the [pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics) of place.  

We aim to develop a toolkit to help guide travelers through unfamiliar territory.  More ambitiously, we'd like to facilitate the construction of a network of micro-expeditions curated by local insiders.

Our initial toolset is targeted at Airbnb [superhosts](https://www.airbnb.com/superhost) and their guests, viz ...

![trax](images/trax.png)

**Trax** is a tool for encoding a host's personal psychogeography: their own
idiosyncratic view of home and neighborhood.  It's the napkin on which a host
can sketch out a personalized map of their domain for guests.

![trex](images/trex.png)

**Trex** is a companion tool for guests.  It provides access to a host's
**trax**, the curated micro-expeditions originating from their accomodations.

So, we way that a host *lays* **trax** and a guest *undertakes* **trex** along
these trax.

What's novel about **trax** is that they form a network of possible
experiences. A guest undertaking a trek along their host's trax can access the
trax of other hosts from that locality whenever accessible (i.e., when
they intersect at some node point).  This enables guests unfamiliar with a given place access to a network of local micro expeditions from those who know that locality best.
