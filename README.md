New endeavors require new terms, but naming is a tricky endeavor.

Instead of naming things once and for all, I think it's useful to first coin a few provisional terms.  These can serve as placeholders, allowing us to differentiate pieces of the larger project without prematuraly committing us to 
a set of terms that ultimately don't cohere.

The terms that follows should be understood as such: ad hoc coinages, functioning as provisional standins for more suitable, reflectively derived names.
