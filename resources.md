## Books

* [Image of the city](https://books.google.com/books?id=_phRPWsSpAgC) - by Kevin Lynch. Essential reading. See [review](http://themobilecity.nl/2009/05/08/review-kevin-lynch-the-image-of-the-city/)

* [Ambient commons: attention in the age of embodied information](https://books.google.com/books?id=vb0XAAAAQBAJ&dq=ambient+commons) - by Malcolm McCullogh. A call to rethink attention itself, to care for more situated, often inescapable forms of information.

> McCullough asks us to become “stewards” of information. By embedding data with care and generating structures for participation, overload and distraction can be replaced with concentration and embodiment.
